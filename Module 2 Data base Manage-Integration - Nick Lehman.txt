//Hi, I Nick, struggled a little with this, so sorry if it sounds bad or is hard to understand.  I tried hard, though!
Start
// first, we need the variables needed for the data
Input list Employee names
Input list Employee IDs
Input Entered ID 
Input list Overtime hours
Input list Normal time hours
Create List item
Create Input

//Now we can get started
//If we are editing the data, we need to be able to add, remove, and check the data so
Back to loop
Set input = Input
     If Input = "adding"
//output person added and add them by name and code
//Check if that person is in the database.  If so, error out and reset to the beginning. If not, add them, then proceed to the beginning.
          Output "What's the Employee ID number?"
          input = Entered ID
               If array.Employee IDs.includes(Entered ID)
                    Output "Error, Employee with entered ID already in the System."
                    Go back to line 14
               else
                    Add (Entered ID) to list (Employee IDs) before item number 1
                    Output "What's their full legal name?"
                    input = input
                    Add (Input) to list (Employee names) before item number 1
                    Add 0 to list Overtime hours before item number 1
                    Add 0 to list Normal time hours before item number 1
//Removing them is next up in the possibility.  First, we make sure they exist in the system
          If input = "removing"
               Output "Which employee are we terminating from the system?"
               Entered ID = Input
//Now we have to see if they are actually in the system
                    If array. Employee IDs.includes(Entered ID)
                         Set (List item) to list (Employee IDs) item number (Entered ID)
                         Delete item number (List item) from list (Employee IDs)
                         Delete item number (List item) from list (Employee names)
                         Delete item number (List item) from list (Overtime hours)
                         Delete item number (List item) from list (Normal time hours)
//After purging them from the database, it goes back to the start
                         Go back to line 14
                    else
